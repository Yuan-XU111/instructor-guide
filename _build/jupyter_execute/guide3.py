# # How to set a new type of a question
# 
# It is needed to write some codes to test if the student's code meets the requirements every time we want to set up a customized question.
# 
# The requirements could be same sometimes. Therefore, we can define a particular judging mode first and adapt it to a series of questions to reduce the work.
# 
# ## Click "create a new question" at the question page

# 
# ## Select "code runner" as a normal question
#

# 
# ## Select the language (we use python 3 here) and choose "Customise".

# ## Open "Advanced customisation" and select "Yes(user defined)", name it as the question type
#
